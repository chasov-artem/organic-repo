# Organic Fashion React Layout

ðŸ§ª **React + Redux + SCSS (BEM)**

## Description

This project is a responsive website layout based on the [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1316469446514771340) using React, Redux, and SCSS with BEM methodology. All texts and images are stored in the Redux store. Components are logically split and reusable.
